# Code Overview 
### for code review

The primary parts of the code are located in the "src" folder. The containers folder has the typescript files that make up the structure of each of the webpages. The "List" container is used to structure the Grocery List and Pantry List pages. The Search.txs file corresponds to the recipe search page, saved.tsx for the Saved Recipes Page and the Login and Landing files handle initial user interaction and authentication.  

The Components folder makes up the repeated parts of each web page. Nav is used on every page except for the landing page to navigate to difference pages. The Recipe.tsx file codes for the structure and functionality of the recipe cards that appear on the Recipe Search and Saved Recipe Pages. The ListItem and AddItemForm files are used with the List pages to display ingredient information and submit new ingredients respectively. 




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
